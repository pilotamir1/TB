   Table structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE candles (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

       timestamp INT NOT NULL,
       open FLOAT NOT NULL,
       high FLOAT NOT NULL,
       low FLOAT NOT NULL,
       close FLOAT NOT NULL,
       volume FLOAT NOT NULL,
       created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       INDEX idx_symbol_timestamp (symbol, timestamp)
   );
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Initialize database connections
2. Start the web dashboard on http://localhost:5000
3. Begin model training with intelligent feature selection
4. Start real-time data fetching
5. Begin trading analysis (demo mode by default)

### Web Dashboard
Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` to:
- Monitor training progress
- View real-time trading signals
- Track active positions and P&L
- Control trading start/stop
- Retrain the AI model
- Adjust settings

### Configuration
Key settings in `config/settings.py`:
- `TRADING_CONFIG`: Demo balance, symbols, timeframe, confidence threshold
- `TP_SL_CONFIG`: Take profit and stop loss levels
- `ML_CONFIG`: Training data size, dynamic feature selection, macro F1 optimization
- `COINEX_CONFIG`: API credentials for live trading

5. **Position Manager**: Handles TP/SL and risk management
6. **Web Dashboard**: Provides real-time monitoring and control

## Key Features Detail

### Dynamic Feature Selection
The system intelligently selects features using multiple approaches:

**Dynamic Mode (Performance-Driven)**:
- No fixed feature limit - optimizes for macro F1 score
- Correlation-aware pruning removes redundant features
- Iterative selection with tolerance-based early stopping
- Preserves essential OHLCV and required indicators
- Provides detailed selection history for analysis

**Traditional Modes**:
- **RFE**: Recursive Feature Elimination with RandomForest
- **SHAP**: SHAP-based importance ranking
- **Hybrid**: Combination of RFE and statistical selection

**Configuration**:
```yaml
feature_selection:
  mode: "dynamic"  # or "rfe", "shap", "hybrid"
  dynamic:
    min_features: 20
    metric: 'macro_f1'
    tolerance: 0.003
```

See [docs/dynamic_feature_selection.md](docs/dynamic_feature_selection.md) for detailed documentation.

### TP/SL Management
Advanced position management with:
- **Initial SL**: 2% below entry (LONG) or above entry (SHORT)
- **TP1 at 3%**: Move SL to breakeven (entry price)
- **TP2 at 5%**: Move SL to TP1 level
- **TP3 at 8%**: Move SL to TP2 level
- **Emergency Close**: Close on opposite signal >70% confidence

### Real-Time Updates

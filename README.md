## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Database with TB database and candles table
- CoinEx API credentials (for live trading)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirsofali3/TB.git
   cd TB
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and API credentials
   ```

4. **Database Setup:**
   Ensure your MySQL database has the `TB` database with a `candles` table containing historical OHLCV data for:
   - BTCUSDT
   - ETHUSDT  
   - SOLUSDT
   - DOGEUSDT

   Table structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE candles (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       symbol VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
       timestamp INT NOT NULL,
       open FLOAT NOT NULL,
       high FLOAT NOT NULL,
       low FLOAT NOT NULL,
       close FLOAT NOT NULL,
       volume FLOAT NOT NULL,
       created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       INDEX idx_symbol_timestamp (symbol, timestamp)
   );
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Initialize database connections
2. Start the web dashboard on http://localhost:5000
3. Begin model training with intelligent feature selection
4. Start real-time data fetching
5. Begin trading analysis (demo mode by default)

### Web Dashboard
Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` to:
- Monitor training progress
- View real-time trading signals
- Track active positions and P&L
- Control trading start/stop
- Retrain the AI model
- Adjust settings

### Configuration
Key settings in `config/settings.py`:
- `TRADING_CONFIG`: Demo balance, symbols, timeframe, confidence threshold
- `TP_SL_CONFIG`: Take profit and stop loss levels
- `ML_CONFIG`: Training data size, dynamic feature selection, macro F1 optimization
- `COINEX_CONFIG`: API credentials for live trading

## Key Features Detail

### Dynamic Feature Selection
The system intelligently selects features using multiple approaches:

**Dynamic Mode (Performance-Driven)**:
- No fixed feature limit - optimizes for macro F1 score
- Correlation-aware pruning removes redundant features
- Iterative selection with tolerance-based early stopping
- Preserves essential OHLCV and required indicators
- Provides detailed selection history for analysis

**Traditional Modes**:
- **RFE**: Recursive Feature Elimination with RandomForest
- **SHAP**: SHAP-based importance ranking
- **Hybrid**: Combination of RFE and statistical selection

**Configuration**:
```yaml
feature_selection:
  mode: "dynamic"  # or "rfe", "shap", "hybrid"
  dynamic:
    min_features: 20
    metric: 'macro_f1'
    tolerance: 0.003
```

See [docs/dynamic_feature_selection.md](docs/dynamic_feature_selection.md) for detailed documentation.

### TP/SL Management
Advanced position management with:
- **Initial SL**: 2% below entry (LONG) or above entry (SHORT)
- **TP1 at 3%**: Move SL to breakeven (entry price)
- **TP2 at 5%**: Move SL to TP1 level
- **TP3 at 8%**: Move SL to TP2 level
- **Emergency Close**: Close on opposite signal >70% confidence

### Real-Time Updates
